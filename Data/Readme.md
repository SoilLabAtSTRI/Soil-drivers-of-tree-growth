The data directories are structured as follows:

The subdirectory "Raw Data" holds the .rdata census data files, the canopy occupancy survey data, and the allometry data
The subdirectory "Growth Data" is where all calculated light data and the census data files, converted into .rds files, are located.
The Data directory itself is where model outputs (model objects, model coefficients etc) are located.
