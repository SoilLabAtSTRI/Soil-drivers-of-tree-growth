The data directories are structured as follows:

The subdirectory "Raw Data" holds the .rdata census data files, the canopy occupancy survey data, and the allometry data
The subdirectory "Growth Data" is where all calculated light data and the census data files, converted into .rds files, are located.
The Data directory itself is where model outputs (model objects, model coefficients etc) and model parameters are located.

All interpolated data files are also in the Data directory:
Interpolated soil data and the kriging parameters used to generate them

Species lists, to enable identification of palm and legume species in the plot (by genera), were obtained from http://www.theplantlist.org
