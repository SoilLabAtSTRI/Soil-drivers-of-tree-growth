To successfully run the R scripts (which generate rds files) the .rdata census data files need to be placed in this directory.
The tree census data can be obtained from two sources: 
1) Vetted and checked source from conditdatacenter.org
2) From ForestGEO/CTFS: https://www.forestgeo.si.edu/explore-data or http://ctfs.si.edu/webatlas/datasets/bci/
